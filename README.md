# nats-connector
A pluggable service to bridge NATS and other technologies

## Work in Progress
Code here is prototype/experimental code, incomplete, and not ready for public consumption.  Feel free to browse, but using this right now would not be a good idea.

### Source code (this repository)
To download the source code:
```
git clone git@github.com:nats-io/nats-connector.git .
```

To build the library, use [maven](https://maven.apache.org/). From the root directory of the project:

```
mvn clean install
```
